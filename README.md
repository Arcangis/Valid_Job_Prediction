# Job Post Validator

## Introduction
Project created as the Midterm Project  for the online bootcamp: Machine Learning Zoomcamp ([link](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code)).

### Problem:

Searching for work is an arduous and repetitive process, often leading to no feedback and a giant waste of time. To turn things more difficult, there are fraudulent job posts mixed in.

The project's objective is to analyze various data from job offers and try to classify which are fraudulents and which are not.

Using insights from: 
- Most frequent used keywords in title;
- Salary Range;
- Offer had requirements?
- Offer had benefits?
- employment_type;
- required_experience;
- required_education;
- Offer had telecommuting (Remote Work)?
- Department;
- Industry;
- Function;   
- Location;
- Company had a profile?
- Company had a logo?
- Job(site) had questions?

Dataset can be found in datasets folder, or by downloading from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/real-or-fake-jobs).

This dataset contains 18K job descriptions out of which about 800 are fake. The data consists of both textual information and meta-information about the jobs. The dataset can be used to create classification models which can learn from the job information which ones are fraudulent. (Font: kaggle)

1. Intall virtualenv:
```
pip install virtualenv
```
2. Create a virtualenv(ubuntu):
```
python3 -m venv <env_name>
```
3. Activate the environment(ubuntu):
```
source <env_name>/bin/activate
```
4. Install all modules/dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. Build the application docker:
```
docker build -t <docker_img_name> .
```
6. Run the application docker:
```
docker run -it -p 9696:9696 <docker_img_name>:latest
```

Now the application is running and is ready to receive request for predictions.

BONUS:

1. Run prediction tests
```
python predict_test.py
```
2. For more tests, change the content from job_post with data from [test dataset](datasets/data_for_test.csv).

Example:
```
job_post = {
    'salary_range_min': 0,
    'salary_range_max': 0,
    'title': 'engineer',
    'location': 'gb, , london',
    'department': 'other',
    'employment_type': 'full-time',
    'required_experience': 'entry level',
    'required_education': 'unspecified',
    'industry': 'apparel & fashion',
    'function': 'information technology',
    'company_profile': 1,
    'requirements': 0,
    'benefits': 0,
    'telecommuting': 0,
